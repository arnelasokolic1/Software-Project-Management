# Cinema Ticket Booking App

This app aims to revolutionize the movie-watching experience by providing users with a seamless and stress-free ticket-booking process. The goal is to empower users to take control of their entertainment choices while enhancing the overall movie-watching experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

## Vision

The Cinema Ticket Booking App is designed to empower users by providing a convenient and hassle-free platform for booking movie tickets. Our vision is to go beyond mere convenience and inspire users with a movie-watching experience that is seamless and stress-free. By bringing together all cinemas on a unified platform, we aim to transform the movie-watching experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

## Roadmap
Also, I did the Roadmap for the application.

### 1st Quarter - MVP
In the first quarter, primary focus is on establishing a user-friendly interface and gathering initial user feedback. Key features include user account creation, basic ticket booking, and cinema selection. Success will be measured by user sign-ups, app downloads, and user feedback.

### 2nd Quarter - Version 2
Version 2 involves implementing user feedback and introducing advanced features like advanced search, seat selection, and in-app notifications. Metrics for this phase include active users, feature usage, and user satisfaction.

### 3rd Quarter - Version 3
The goal for the third quarter is to monetize the app and partner with more cinemas. New features include in-app purchases and a loyalty program. Success will be measured by in-app purchase revenue, the number of partners, and user reviews.

### 4th Quarter - Version 4
The final quarter focuses on enhancing user loyalty and expanding market reach. Features to be introduced include a personalized user experience, movie recommendations, and social sharing. Metrics for this phase include user retention rate and market share.
